# countdown

Trying to make a program to facilitate playing the game of countdown over the internet. 
Countdown is a competitive game where you get 9 random letters and try to make the longest word in order to get points and a numbers component where you get 6 random numbers and you have to use those to get a target number between 100 and 1000.
The alphabet is weighted like a scrabble game. 

Future Goals:Word checkers(dictionary api to check a word) and numbers game solver.
